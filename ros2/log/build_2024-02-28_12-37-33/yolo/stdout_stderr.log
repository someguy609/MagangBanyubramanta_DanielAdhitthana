[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindInferenceEngine.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "InferenceEngine", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "InferenceEngine"
  with any of the following names:

    InferenceEngineConfig.cmake
    inferenceengine-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "InferenceEngine" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "InferenceEngine_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "InferenceEngine" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
